# PowerBI-Project

This is a part of Data analysis project focused on showing my knowledge of PowerBI software workings.
This Project is Called Madhav Ecommerce Sales Dashboard. In this porject I have created an interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data.
I have used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers.
Also I created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualizations.
For creating visualization I have used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, etc).
